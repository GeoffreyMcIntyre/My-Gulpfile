# My-Gulpfile
The gulpfile I have built for my project/s. I will try update this whenever I make changes

## Instructions
gulp                    (To run gulp)

gulp --type production  (To run gulp with production output)

gulp test               (To run Mocha Chai tests)

## Note
It will use the port set in your server.js, not the port set in browserSync.

"Open" can be turned off to stop it opening the page when started and refreshing the page when changes are detected.
